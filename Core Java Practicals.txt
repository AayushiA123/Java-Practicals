Core Java-

Practical 1: Write a program to print “Hello world”.
- If / else condition:

Practical 2: Write a program to demonstrate the use of if / else statements. (E.g
Define an 'age' variable and check your age).


- Switch case statement:
Practical 3: Write a program to find the current month name from the given number
of the switch case.


- While loop / do-while loop:
Practical 4: Write a program to demonstrate the use of while loop and do while loop.
(E.g print 1 to 10 numbers).


- For loop:
Practical 5: Write a program to demonstrate the example of the ‘for’ loop and print
the below-mentioned pattern.


- Break / Continue Statement:
Practical 6: Write a program to demonstrate the example of a break/Continue
statement (E.g. Use the loop for 10 numbers and stop the execution after 7 numbers
and skip any number).


- Constructors:
Practical 7: Write a program to demonstrate the example of constructor and
Parameterized constructor (E.g. Pass two integer parameters and apply any
mathematical formula).


- Operators:
Practical 8: Apply EMI Calculator in Java - Java program to calculate EMI using
Class, Object, Variables, Operators, and Datatypes.


- Wrapper classes:
Practical 9: Create a practical to compare two variables of Wrapper class using
Wrapper classes.


Practical 10: Create programs of all the string methods like charAt(), concat(),
equals() etc.
Practical 10A: Create programs to evaluate differences between == and .equals in
String, Integer, and BigDecimal?
- this / super:


Practical 11: Write a practical to use this/super variable.
- Static keyword:


Practical 12: Write a program to demonstrate static methods, variables, and blocks
